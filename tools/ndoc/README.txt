NDoc
----

NDoc generates class libraries documentation from .NET assemblies and 
the XML documentation files generated by the C# compiler (or an add-on 
tool for VB.NET).  NDoc uses add-on documenters to generate documentation 
in several different formats, including MSDN-style HTML Help files (.chm)
or HTML Help 2 format, and MSDN-online style web pages.

The NDoc source code is freely available under a certified Open Source 
license. We welcome everyone to use our software in the hopes that they can 
provide feedback, submit bug reports and fixes, or even join us as a 
developer!


Status
------

NDoc's MSDN and HtmlHelp2 documenters are stable, but there is still quite 
a bit of work to be done on the JavaDoc, LaTeX and LinearHtml documenters. 

See http://ndoc.sf.net/ for the latest information on releases.


Building NDoc
-------------

If you have Visual Studio .NET 2003, you can build NDoc using the 
NDoc.sln file located in this folder.

If you don't have VS.NET but do have the .NET Framework SDK and NAnt 
v0.8.4 or above (http://nant.sf.net/) installed, then you can 
build NDoc using the ndoc.build file located in this folder. Just type 
nant from within that directory and you should be good to go.

If you don't have the .NET Framework SDK installed then why do you even
want to use this?

You will also need the Visual Studio Help Integration Kit (VSHIK) installed. NDoc
uses the Html Help 2 compiler, which is a COM server. 

VSHIK can be obtained free from Microsoft at: 
http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/default.asp?url=/library/en-us/htmlhelp/html/hwmscextendingnethelp.asp


Using NDoc
----------

A list of tags supported by the MSDN documenter can be found in the .\doc 
folder.

If you want to create a .CHM file and you don't have VS.NET installed then
you're going to need to download and install Microsoft's HTML Help
Workshop.

Start NDocGui.exe. You can add your assembly/doc files manually or import
them from a VS.NET .sln file. If this UI's not intuitive enough then feel
free to add a bug report to our project as described below.

You can also invoke NDoc from the command line. Try typing NDocConsole.exe
with no options to see how it's supposed to be used. This is great for 
automated builds.

After you build NDoc, you can load one of our example projects from the
examples directory. This should give you a good idea of what NDoc outputs.


Support
-------

Since this is an Open Source project which we work on in our spare time, you
won't be getting any support. But if you do find a bug or have a comment and
you post it to our mailing list or one of our trackers on SourceForge then
we'll try really hard to help you out. Some bugs have been fixed and features
added within meer hours. Others have taken a few weeks. (That's still faster
than most closed source products!)

You can subscribe to any of our mailing lists here:

http://sourceforge.net/mail/?group_id=36057

You can submit a bug report or feature request here:

http://sourceforge.net/tracker/?group_id=36057

If you do submit something to our tracker, please make sure you're logged in
to SourceForge or leave your email address in the submission if you don't 
want a SourceForge account. That way we can can contact you for further 
questions or let you know when we fix whatever it is you need.

We love getting feedback so don't hesitate to contact us!
