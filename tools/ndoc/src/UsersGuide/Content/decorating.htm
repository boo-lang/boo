	<p>The more code comments you add to your code, the more descriptive the generated 
	help topics will be. That makes your help file more useful to the users of your 
	assemblies.</p>
	<p>At a minimum each public type, and the public and protected members of your 
	public types, should have a <strong><a href="tags.htm#summary">&lt;summary&gt;</a></strong> 
	item describing what the member does or represents.</p>
	<p>The VS.NET C# code editor has a handy feature that makes it easy to create 
	the basic code comments for each type and member:</p>
	<p>For the following code snippet:</p>
	<div class="csharpcode">
		<span class="kwrd">public class</span> MyClass() {
		<div class="codescopeblock">
			<span class="kwrd">public</span> MyClass( <span class="kwrd">string</span> 
			s ) { } </div>
		} </div>
	<p>if you place your cursor just above the <b>MyClass</b> constructor, and hit 
	the &#39;/&#39; character three times in a row, VS.NET will create the skeleton of a 
	code comment block for that member: </p>
	<div class="csharpcode">
		<span class="kwrd">public class</span> MyClass() {
		<div class="codescopeblock">
			<div class="codecomment">
				/// &lt;summary&gt; </div>
			<div class="codecomment">
				/// </div>
			<div class="codecomment">
				/// &lt;/summary&gt; </div>
			<div class="codecomment">
				/// &lt;param name=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&lt;/param&gt; </div>
			<span class="kwrd">public</span> MyClass( <span class="kwrd">string</span> 
			s ) { } </div>
		} </div>
	<p>This applies to any type or member that can have code comment tags associated 
	with it. Further more, once you have a code comment block, when you hit the 
	&#39;&lt;&#39; key to start a new tag, VS.NET will display an intellisense selector showing 
	the appropriate list of code comment tags. Unfortunately this list won&#39;t include 
	the additional tags that NDoc supports, but you can still add them by hand.</p>
	<p>NDoc includes options that allow you to generate documentation for private 
	and internal items. This is useful when you are using NDoc to generate in-house 
	documentation. If you plan to use NDoc in this way you should also add code 
	comments to types and members that would not normally be visible outside of 
	the assembly.</p>
