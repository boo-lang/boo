			<h3 class="dtH3">Deploying Html Help 2</h3>
			<p>The Html Help 2 system maintains a registry of all help collections and titles 
				currently installed on a machine. This registry determines what help titles are 
				included in each help collection as well as maintains references between help 
				collections.</p>
			<p>In order to view an Html Help 2 title or collection it is required that it be 
				registered. This makes deploying Html Help 2 documentation more complex than 
				simply delivering a single file as with CHM based help.</p>
			<h4 class="dtH4">Windows Installer</h4>
			<p>It is possible to create Windows Installer packages to deploy and properly 
				register help collections and titles. VSHIK <a href="ms-help://ms.vshik.2003/dv_mshlpwrk/html/hxconRedistributingHelpFiles.htm">
					includes detailed instructions</a> on how to go about this as well as a set 
				of merge modules that contain the registration actions. Unfortunately, it is a 
				rather involved process that includes a number of manual steps to create the 
				proper records in the installer database. There is currently no way to automate 
				the generation of Windows Installer packages for Html Help 2 files.</p>
			<h4 class="dtH4">H2Reg</h4>
			<p>Another option is to use the <a target="_blank" href="http://helpware.net/mshelp2/h2reg.htm">
					shareware tool H2Reg.exe</a> from <a target="_blank" href="http://www.helpware.net">
					helpware.net</a>. H2Reg is a command line utility that will register help 
				collections and titles during installation. It can be included in scripted 
				installer as well as Windows Installer packages as a custom action.</p>
			<p>If the setting <a href="vsnet.htm#GenerateCollectionFiles">GenerateCollectionFiles</a>
				is <b>true</b>, NDoc will create an H2Reg compatible INI file that contains the 
				proper values to register the generated help title, as well as plug it into the 
				VS.NET help collection.</p>
			<p>In order to deploy the NDoc generated Html Help 2 files with H2Reg, follow these 
				steps:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>
					Set <b>GenerateCollectionFiles</b> to <b>true</b>
				<li>
				Include all of the generated help files as well as the generated INI file in 
				your installer.
				<li>
					Include the H2Reg executable as well as the file <b>H2Reg.ini</b>
				(located in the directory where you installed H2Reg) in your installer.
				<li>
				During installation copy the help files as well as the generated INI file to 
				there final location.
				<li>
					Execute H2Reg with the following syntax:
					<p class="code">H2reg -r "CmdFile=&lt;full path to the generated INI file&gt;"</p>
				<li>
					During uninstallation, before the help files are removed, execute H2Reg with 
					the following syntax:
					<p class="code">H2reg -u "CmdFile=&lt;full path to the generated INI file&gt;"
					</p>
				</li>
			</ol>
