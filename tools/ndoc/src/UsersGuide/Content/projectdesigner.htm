	<p>The assemblies that you want to document are organized in a project file. 
	The project file keeps the list of assemblies as well as the settings you set 
	that determine how your documentation will appear. </p>

	<p>&nbsp;</p>
	<p><a href="createproject.htm">Creating a new NDoc project</a> is merely a 
	matter of selecting the assemblies that will be included, selecting a 
	documentation style, and setting the properties of your documentation.</p>
	<h3 class="dtH3">Namespace Summaries</h3>
	<p>The standard C# documentation tags don't include any way to 
	provide a summary for a namespace. NDoc supports two mechanisms for 
	specifying namespace summaries. One is by supplying them in a special code 
	file within your project. The other is via the project designer.</p>
	<p>In the project designer, click the &quot;Namespace Summaries&quot; 
	button and you will be presented with a dialog that allows you to set a 
	namespace summary for each namespace in your project.</p>
	<p>These summaries will be included in the compiled 
	documentation</p>
	<img src="images/editnamespace.jpg"/>
	<p class="fineprint">The Namespace Summary Dialog</p>
	<h3 class="dtH3">Documenter Settings</h3>
	<p>Each Documenter shares some basic settings, like what types 
	of members to document and where to create the final output. Each Documenter 
	also has its own specific settings that govern its operation. These settings 
	can be modified in the Project Designer and saved as part of your project.</p>
	<p>Settings are organized by category. When you select a 
	setting in the property control, you will see a short explanation of what the 
	setting does. This is a good way to familiarize yourself with how each 
	Documenter works and what it is capable of.</p>
	<p>For a complete list of the documenters and their settings, 
	refer to the <a href="documenters.htm">Documenters Topic</a>.</div>
