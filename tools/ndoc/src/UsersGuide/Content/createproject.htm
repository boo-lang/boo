	<h3 class="dtH3">Creating a New Project and Adding Assemblies</h3>
	<p>If you use Visual Studio.NET as your development environment, the easiest 
	way to create a new NDoc project is to select the &quot;New From Visual Studio&quot; button 
	on the toolbar. </p>
	<img src="images/newfromvsnet.JPG" border="1">
	<p>&nbsp;</p>
	<p>After browsing to your solution file, you will be asked to select a configuration 
	within the solution. This determines what assemblies (debug or release versions) 
	will be used to generate your documentation.</p>
	<p>&nbsp;</p>
	<img src="images/configuration.JPG" border="1">
	<p><strong class="fineprint">The Configuration Selection Dialog</strong></p>
	<p><strong></strong>&nbsp;</p>
	<p>Once you select a configuration, the NDoc project designer will add all of 
	the managed assembly projects from that solution to your new NDoc project.</p>
	<p>If you don&#39;t use Visual Studio.NET, you can add assemblies to your project 
	either by browsing for them with the <strong>Add</strong> button, or dragging 
	them into the assembly list view directly from Window Explorer. Make sure that 
	you are generating XML documentation during your compiles, otherwise NDoc will only be able to produce minimal documentation...</p>
	<h3 class="dtH3">Choosing a Documenter</h3>
	<p>NDoc ships with a number of different options for generating documentation 
	for your code. Each different format is referred to as a <strong>Documenter</strong>. 
	Each Documenter determines it own layout, formatting, and in some cases content 
	for the generated documentation.</p>
	<p>The two most popular documenters are the MSDN documenter, which generate 
	compiled CHM type documentation similar to MSDN online help, and the VS.NET 
	documenter, which generates compiled html help compatible with Visual Studio.NET.</p>
	<p>&nbsp;</p>
	<img src="images/selectdocumenter.JPG" border="1">
	<p><strong class="fineprint">NDoc Documenters</strong></p>
	<p>&nbsp;</p>
	<p>All documenters share certain settings, such as what types of members to document. 
	Each documenter also has its own set of custom settings which you can use to 
	control the exact content of your documentation.</p>
	<p>For more details about configuring documenters, refer to the
	<a href="documenters.htm">Documenters section</a>.</p>
	<h3 class="dtH3">Building the Documentation</h3>
	<p>Once you&#39;ve chosen a Documenter, and configured it to your liking, hit the 
	Build Button to create your documentation. As the project builds and compiles, 
	you will see build status in the Output Window at the bottom of the Designer 
	Screen, as well as in a progress indicator on the status bar.</p>

	<h3 class="dtH3">Viewing the Documentation</h3>
	<p>Once the build completes, you can view the resulting 
	documentation by clicking the View button.</div>
