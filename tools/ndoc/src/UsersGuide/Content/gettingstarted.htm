			<p>There are some additional tools you'll need to get in order to produce certain 
				kinds of help titles. These tools are available online.
			</p>
			<h1 class="dtH1">HTML Help Compilers</h1>
			<p>The necessary HTML Help compilers are freely available from Microsoft.</p>
			<h4 class="dtH4">HTML Help Version 1</h4>
			<p>HTML Help 1 titles are the CHM files that most applications use for their help 
				file format. This is the help technology used by MSDN prior to the release of 
				Visual Studio.NET.
			</p>
			<p>If you plan to create compiled Html Help 1 titles (CHM files), you will need to 
				make sure you have <a target="_blank" href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/default.asp?url=/library/en-us/htmlhelp/html/hwMicrosoftHTMLHelpDownloads.asp">
					Microsoft's HTML Help Workshop</a>. This download includes the compiler 
				capable of creating CHM help titles.
			</p>
			<p></p>
			<h4 class="dtH4">HTML Help Version 2</h4>
			<p>HTML Help 2 is the help technology the Visual Studio.NET 2002 and 2003, and 
				current versions of MSDN use.
			</p>
			<p>If you plan to create help titles that integrate with the VS.NET help system, 
				you will need to <a target="_blank" href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/default.asp?url=/library/en-us/htmlhelp/html/hwmscextendingnethelp.asp">
					download the Visual Studio Help Integration Kit (VSHIK)</a>. This download 
				includes the compiler capable of creating HxS help titles.
			</p>
			<h4 class="dtH4">Latex Compiler</h4>
			<p>If you intend to use the LaTeX documenter, you will need a compiler capable of 
				generating dvi or pdf files. You can download a free one from <a href="http://www.miktex.org">
					http://www.miktex.org</a>.</p>
			<h3 class="dtH3">Other Tools</h3>
			<h4 class="dtH4">H2Reg</h4>
			<p>Deploying compiled HTML Help 2 titles and integrating them into your customers 
				Visual Studio.NET help system can be tricky. The VSHIK download <a href="ms-help://ms.vshik.2003/dv_mshlpwrk/html/hxconRedistributingHelpFiles.htm">
					includes detailed instructions on how to do this</a> using Windows 
				Installer and a set of merge modules that are part of the integration kit 
				download.
			</p>
			<p>An alternative method is to <a target="_blank" href="http://helpware.net/mshelp2/h2reg.htm">
					use the H2Reg utility</a> from <a target="_blank" href="http://www.helpware.net">
					helpware.net</a>.
			</p>
			<p>H2Reg is a shareware executable that can be included in your help title 
				deployment projects. It can be used to register help titles, and plug them into 
				the VS.NET help system.</p>
			<p>H2Reg uses an INI file to describe the help title and to control how it is 
				registered and plugged into existing help collections. The VS.NET Documenter 
				includes an option that will generate an H2Reg compatible INI file for your 
				NDoc created HTML Help 2 titles.
