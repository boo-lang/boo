			<h3 class="dtH3">Using VS.NET Build Events</h3>
			<p>Build events can be used to invoke NDoc when build a VS.NET solution. Because 
				NDoc builds can be time consuming it is recommended that they only be included 
				in Release builds or in a special documentation build configuration.
			</p>
			<p>Because build events for C# projects are not configuration based, it is 
				necessary to check the configuration name if you do not want NDoc to run every 
				time a build occurs. This can be accomplished using VS.NET's built in build 
				variables:</p>
			<PRE>	if $(ConfigurationName) == Release</PRE>
			<P>Because specifying all of NDoc's command line paramters directly in the build 
				event editing window can be difficult and error prone, calling a batch file can 
				be easier to manage and maintain. Use the Post-Build event for the last project 
				in the solution that will be built or for each project for which you want 
				seperate documentation.</P>

			<p>For simple solutions the following batch file will invoke NDoc for each Release 
				build.</p>

"%ProgramFiles%\NDoc 1.3\bin\net\1.1\NDocConsole.exe" -recurse="%2bin\%1"

:end</pre>
			</BLOCKQUOTE>
			<p>More complex solutions may require additional parameters such as reference 
				directories etc.</p>
			<H3 class="dtH3">Using Other Build Tools</H3>
			<p>NDoc can be included in builds orchestrated by any build tool that supports 
				executing command line applications. The exact mechanism will be specific to 
				the tool, but most (if not all) support arbitrary execution of executables with 
				paramters.</p>
